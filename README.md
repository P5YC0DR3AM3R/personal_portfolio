# Personal Portfolio

## Website created as a portfolio for coding development and design. To be continually updated with content directly related to my coding and developer journey.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
